Note:
* Linux relies on runlevels to determine what features are available.
* Runlevels are numbered from 0 to 6, and each one is assigned a set of services that should be active.
* Upon booting, Linux enters a predetermined runlevel, which you can set.
* Knowing what these functions are, and how to manage runlevels, is important if you’re to control theLinux boot process and ongoing operations.
* Toward this end, you must understand the purpose of runlevels, be able to identify the services that are active in a runlevel, be able to adjust those services, be able to check your default and current runlevels, and be able to change the default and current runlevels.
* Complicating matters, two major startup systems, SysV startup scripts and Upstart, are available, and each provides different ways of doing these practical tasks, although both employ similar runlevel concepts.
